## About this project
*Last updated: February 11, 2021*

This project is maintained by current students of Goldsmiths, University of London [BSc 'Computing and information systems'](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101125948/https://london.ac.uk/courses/computing-and-information-systems) and [BSc 'Creative computing'](https://web.archive.org/web/20190506192952/https://london.ac.uk/courses/creative-computing)  international online programs (CIS/CC, for short). We are tracing university administration violations of their own policies, agreements and common sense expectations.

The reason for creating this project is the current situation with CIS/CC programs. A few years ago CIS/CC were average quality distance/online programs, generally worth time and money the students had spent on them. 

This situation changed radically in 2020. Rapid deterioration of CIS/CC programs quality started with an attempt of UOL to impose invasive online proctoring system for 2019-20 academic year exams. Later, in September 2020 CIS/CC programs were closed for new applicants and the maximum registration period for remaining students was decreased. 

At about the same time, UOL started [BSc Computer Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london) program at Coursera. This new program is approx. 2x times more expensive than CIS/CC. Remaining CIS/CC students were advised to switch to the new program. They were given 1 week to figure everything out, get the answers from the UOL and make a decision about their further education.

The new 2020-21 academic year has brought some new violations of UOL policies and agreements between the university and CIS/CC students (see list of cases). During the discussion of these matters at 'Student Cafe' forum [Dr. Maggie Cooper](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/people/cooper-maggie/), Programmes Director advised us to follow the official [complaint procedure](https://london.ac.uk/current-students/complaints-and-appeals-procedure).

Being aware of the complaint procedure we at the same time are sceptical about the ability of this approach to resolve current situation (e.g. it was not enough to stop invasive online proctoring during previous exams). Since the complaint procedure is not very effective, ***we decided to create this project as the public incentive for the university to straighten its course of action.***

We are planning to employ both official complaint procedure and this project pages (and, possibly, other approaches, too) in order to resolve the described problems.


## List of cases

### An attempt to impose invasive online proctoring system for 2019-20 academic year exams
		
**Date**: 01 June 2020  
	
**Severity**: High

**Number of students affected**: 200+
	
**Description**: Right before the examination period of 2019-20 the university made an attempt to impose invasive online proctoring system [Proctortrack](https://www.proctortrack.com/) on CIS/CC students. The [complaint letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7HzbQ345-UGVflReGK-SCQfXlYilF3wRREb-U10lSY/edit) was composed, signed by 108  students and sent to [professor Mary Stiasny](https://london.ac.uk/mary-stiasny). This letter didn't have an immediate effect on UOL actions. Some time after that a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-london-stop-invasive-online-proctoring-at-university-of-london-and-provide-fair-alternative) was posted at Change.org. It was signed by 215 students. Finally, 26th of June 2020 UOL gave up the idea of using Proctortrack during 2019-20 CIS/CC examinations.

### Maximum registration period decreased for some of the students
		
**Date**: 10 September 2020  
	
**Severity**: High

**Number of students affected**: n/a (probably, 10-100 students)
	
**Description**: 10th September 2020 'Notification of the withdrawal of the BSc Computing and Information Systems and BSc Creative Computing programmes' was sent to the students by [Ms Pamela Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamela-roberts-b6061a129/), Director of Student Recruitment and Enrollment. Here's an excerpt from this letter:
> Following a review of our distance and flexible learning programmes, the University of London has decided to close the above programmes to new applicants. The programmes are to be phased out. However, you will still be able to complete the programme by the academic year 2024 – 2025, after which time these programmes will no longer be offered. This means that your maximum period of registration from your effective date of registration (the first time you registered with us on this programme) will no longer be a full eight-year period for the BSc. 

> The withdrawal of the programmes will not affect the quality or nature of your studies in any way. Both Goldsmiths, University of London and the University of London remain committed to you and all other students studying the BSc Computing and Information Systems programme or the BSc in Creative Computing. We will continue to ensure that the programmes are delivered to the usual high academic standard throughout the notice period. 

Aside from the fact that the first paragraph of this letter contradicts with the second paragraph, the cited text also means that some of the students, probably, faced the situation when they would no longer be able to successfully complete their BSc program. CIS/CC Programme specification ([official link](https://computing.elearning.london.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/75243/mod_resource/content/1/prog-spec-comp-2020-21.pdf) / [mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyashin/CIS-CC-UOL-violations/master/documents/prog-spec-comp-2020-21.pdf)) (2020, p.6) has explicit values for the maximum and minimum periods of registration for BSc programmes:

![Registration periods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyashin/CIS-CC-UOL-violations/master/images/RegistrationPeriods.jpg)  


It is a known fact that some of the students, who work full-time, were planning to use all the possible period of their registration. Also, some of them were taking a year off (which is allowed by the UOL regulations). Considering the edge case scenario of BSc student, who enrolled in autumn 2019, we'll see 25% decrease of max. registration period. 

For the 'Work Experience Entry Route' (which has the max. registration period of 3 years itself) students, who enrolled during autumn 2019, BSc CIS/CC program has become unavailable (assumption based on Program specification text).

### 2020-21 academic year coursework assignments were published too late without delaying the deadlines
		
**Date**: 01 December 2020  
	
**Severity**: High

**Number of students affected**: 100-200
	
**Description**: According to established practice level 4 and 5 first coursework assignments are to be given to students 2 months before deadline, roughly 9 weeks. Nevertheless, during 2020-21 academic year the assignments were published with a significant delay. For example:

* CO2209 - Database systems coursework 1 assignment  was released with 3 weeks to complete;
* CO2226 - Software engineering, algorithm design and analysis coursework 1 - with 5 weeks to complete;
* CO2220 - Graphical Object-Oriented and Internet programming in Java coursework 1 - with 6 weeks to complete.

Most of Level 6 courseworks were also published too late, giving the students 4 weeks, in average, to complete the assignments.

The university decided not to change any of coursework deadlines. This situation caused many students an unprecedented stress, especially those taking six Level 6 modules and the Final Year Project.  

In December 2020 these matters were discussed with Dr. Maggie Cooper at the 'Student cafe' UOL forum. She told the students that coursework deadlines wouldn’t be delayed. Instead of this, she said that
> Reducing the time available will mean a corresponding reduction in the level of work students will be able to produce, and examiners will expect this and adjust the marking accordingly.   

Being asked about the explicit marking scheme for this new reduced type of courseworks, she refused to provide any.  A quick note: assessment criteria for the regular courseworks and examinations are available to students at page 31 of Programme regulations 2020-21 ([official link](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/progregs-computing-workexp-new-2020-21.pdf) / [mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyashin/CIS-CC-UOL-violations/master/documents/progregs-computing-workexp-new-2020-21.pdf)). An absence of explicit criteria opens the door to misinterpretation and can adversely affect students' grades. Although, later, 23rd of December 2020, [Kärt Luik, Programme Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k%C3%A4rt-luik-606603179/?originalSubdomain=uk) posted a message with a hint about new marking criteria: 

> Examiners will be expecting less detail, proportionate to the reduction in time available, not partially-completed submissions. Note that we have also adjusted coursework where detailed work is required. 

it was already too late, in our opinion, as the students should have been in the middle of their work by then. Also, it could be proved that at least some of the assignments (CO2226 coursework) were not adjusted according to reduced time available.

This is a mitigating circumstance by definition: 
> Mitigating circumstances are any serious circumstances beyond your control which may have adversely affected your academic performance. (General regulations, p.17 ([official link](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-general-2020-2021.pdf) / [mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyashin/CIS-CC-UOL-violations/master/documents/progregs-general-2020-2021.pdf)) 

Being asked if the students could treat this as a mitigating circumstance and, therefore, hand over their courseworks later, Dr. Maggie Cooper refused to count it as a mit.circ.

Students have filled at least one [complaint letter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyashin/CIS-CC-UOL-violations/master/complaints/UOL_Complaint_Letter_01-29-2021.pdf), although, the result of this is unknown at the moment.

### Most of the study materials are obsolete
		
**Date**: n/a 
	
**Severity**: Medium

**Number of students affected**: 300+
	
**Description**: Most of the written course materials are quite old (some of them were published 15+ years ago). While this is not a problem for fundamental disciplines like Discrete math, it may be an issue for rapidly changing fields of study like Networking, Databases or AI. This problem is mitigated (to some extent) by regularly updated lists of recommended literature.

Here's the complete list of course materials' years of publication:

### University slow response to students' questions/inquiries
		
**Date**: n/a  
	
**Severity**: Medium

**Number of students affected**: n/a (probably, half of the students)
	
**Description**: Among CIS/CC students UOL is notoriously known for its slow reaction to student's inquiries and official forum questions. While it is not usually the case, sometimes students have to wait for weeks before their inquiry is being handled properly or their questions being answered.
